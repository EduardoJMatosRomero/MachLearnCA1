# Project Motivation

Ireland is one of the leading countries in the aviation industry, with companies such as Ryanair or Air Lingus being examples of hugely successful companies across Europe, so to base a project on any of the examples of domains in this industry as part of a portfolio of projects seems to me to be hugely valuable.

# Problem Domain

The topic that has been chosen to be analysed is the price of flight ticket in India for domestic flights, considering for the analysis a data collection from 12 national airlines, 5 sources and 6 destinations.

To analyse and making a prediction of the price of tickets it has been analysed 10 features.

- Features
  - Airline
  - Date of journey
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Route
  - Departure time
  - Arrival time
  - Duration
  - Total stops
  - Additional information

# Methods

Since the objective of our project is to develop a predictive model using machine learning and Python, the method that has been decided to be applied is a regression.

1. To develop a regression model, 7 different regression algorithms were tested.
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Support Vector Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbours Regressor

2. The regression models were tested using 3 different approaches of data train-test splitting, with the intention of choosing the train-test splitting that develops the best performance of the algorithms.

3. The 2 regression models with the best predictive performance were hyperparameter tuned to adapt them to the particular task and conditions on which they were chosen to work.
- Decision Tree hyperparameters tuned:
-** Random Forest hyperparameters tuned:**

4. A final algorithm was chosen to develop the regression machine learning algorithm.
- **Random Forest hyperparameters tuned.**
